					A complimentary pair of orange and blue color is used in most part of this CSS. The sci-fi blue-theme background is chosen to set the overall modern stylish theme of this webpage. All of three colors are picked with adjusting Hue while maintaining similar Saturation and Lightness in the HSL color system to unify all of the colors to be in the same theme. While a space is "inactive", the tab will be transparent to emphasize the sci-fi theme of the page.

					This CSS is aiming to represent the concept of, as the movie background suggest, creating a "transforming" dynamic space. An arrow is put at the end of each banner to signal the user that the space can be expanded in the direction where the arrow is pointing. In addition, the negative space in the right side of the footer (bottom row) also is left out to suggest the direction where the tabs in the footer can be expanded to fill.

					Two fonts in the Sans-Serif family are chosen in order to add to the clean and polished look of the page.

					While a tab is inactive, the background color of the tab will be transparent so that the user will see the dark background through the tab. The tab is not made fully transparent in order to make contrast of the text and background be easy to the eye. After the tab is activated, the background color of the tab will change to emphasize the space to stand out from the others. The text color is changed into white to provide contrast and readability. Since the Lightness value of color of activated tab is not too high, the contrast between the white text and theme color will not be excessive that it becomes unpleasant to the eye to read.
